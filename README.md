# SOLUBILITY-PREDICTION-

## Problem Statement
How are different molecules dissolving in water?

## Dataset
In the following we will use a dataset provided in the dataset collection of PyTorch Geometric ([Here you find all datasets](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html)). The Dataset comes from the MoleculeNet collection


"ESOL is a small dataset consisting of water solubility data for 1128 compounds. The dataset
has been used to train models that estimate solubility directly from chemical structures (as
encoded in SMILES strings). Note that these structures donâ€™t include 3D coordinates, since
solubility is a property of a molecule and not of its particular conformers."
